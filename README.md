## Project Overview
Global Superstore is a global online retailer based in New York, boasting a broad product catalogue and aiming to be a one-stop-shop for its customers. The Global superstore’s clientele, hailing from 147  different countries, can browse through an endless offering with more than 10,000 products. This analysis evaluates sales performance, customer behaviour and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
Question 1. a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?
b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?

Question 2. a) Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.

Question 3. a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries? b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

Question 4. a) Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia. Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. b) Is there a specific country i n Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?

Question 5. a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average profit so low?

Question 6. a) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?

Question 7. a)Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?

## Data Source
The dataset was provided by Digitaley drive as a part of my capstone project. The dataset is made up of three tables namely:

Orders - made up of 51,290 rows and 24 columns.
Returns - made up of 1173 rows and 3 columns.
Persons - made up of 13 rows and 2 columns.

## Tools
For this analysis, PowerBI was majorly used to create data visualization, dashboard and generating insights from the dataset.
Checked for and addressed any blank or duplicate records in the dataset to maintain data integrity. It was observed that each customer had 2 customer IDs and this was consistent across all customers.

## Insights and recommendations
- The Global superstore comprises of 147 countries with a total number of 795 customers.
- They made a total sales of $4 million with a high profit of $504k.
- United states, China and India made the highest profit in 2014.
- Nigeria was the least profitable country in 2014  which was caused by the high rate of average discount compared to other African countries.
- Southeast Asia made a total sales of $884.4k with profit of $14.9k.
- In the Southeast Asia region, Indonesia experienced substantial deficit for the subcategory ''Tables''.  Thus. Global superstore should investigate and probably stop offering the subcategory in those countries of the region.
- Lancaster was the least profitable vity in United States. This is because they offered the most discount, had fewer orders and also had the least sales.
